Beautiful question ðŸŒŸ â€” this is where Promises, the event loop, and timers **intersect**. Letâ€™s break it down.

---

## 1. Code you wrote

```js
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("resolved!");
  }, 1000); 
});

p.then(value => console.log(value));

console.log("end of script");
```

## 2. Step-by-step timeline

1. **Synchronous phase**

   * The `Promise` constructor is called.
   * Its **executor function** runs immediately (synchronously).
   * Inside, you call `setTimeout(...)`.
   * That schedules a **macrotask** (timer) to fire \~1000ms later.
   * At this point the promise is still `pending`.
   * The line `console.log("end of script")` runs.

   ðŸ‘‰ Output so far:

   ```
   end of script
   ```

2. **After \~1000ms**

   * The event loop sees the timer is ready â†’ moves the `setTimeout` callback into the **macrotask queue**.
   * That callback runs:

     ```js
     resolve("resolved!");
     ```
   * The promise transitions from `pending` â†’ `fulfilled`.
   * Any `.then` handlers attached to this promise are scheduled as **microtasks**.

3. **Microtask flush**

   * Before moving on to the next macrotask, the event loop flushes all microtasks.
   * Your `.then` callback runs:

     ```js
     console.log("resolved!");
     ```

   ðŸ‘‰ Final output:

   ```
   end of script
   resolved!
   ```

## 3. Key things to notice

* The **executor** (`new Promise(...)`) runs immediately, but in this case all it does is schedule a timer.
* The promise stays `pending` until the `resolve` is called inside the `setTimeout` callback.
* The `.then` callback isnâ€™t run right when you call `resolve`. Itâ€™s put into the **microtask queue**, so it will run **right after the timerâ€™s callback finishes and before the event loop continues with other macrotasks**.

---

## 4. Visualization

**Call stack / queues flow:**

```
Call Stack: run sync code
 â”œâ”€ Promise executor runs
 â”‚   â””â”€ schedules setTimeout
 â””â”€ console.log("end of script")

Event Loop:
 â”œâ”€ Macrotask queue: (setTimeout callback) after 1000ms
 â”‚   â””â”€ runs â†’ calls resolve("resolved!")
 â”‚       â””â”€ schedules .then callback (microtask)
 â””â”€ Microtask queue: flushes .then â†’ logs "resolved!"
```

---

âœ… So in short:

* **Executor runs immediately.**
* **`setTimeout` schedules a macrotask.**
* When the timer fires, `resolve()` is called â†’ `.then` handlers are put into the **microtask queue**.
* Microtasks always run before the event loop picks the next macrotask.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to extend this with a version where you have **two promises** and a `setTimeout`, so you can clearly see the **microtask vs macrotask order** in action?
