Great question 🙌 — you’re touching the **event loop** and how Promises vs callbacks are scheduled. Let’s unpack it carefully.

---

## 1. Classic callbacks

A callback is just a function passed into another function to run later:

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("callback"), 0);
console.log("sync");
```

👉 Output:

```
sync
callback
```

* `setTimeout` pushes the callback into the **macrotask queue**.
* The event loop runs all synchronous code first, then picks up tasks from the macrotask queue.

---

## 2. Promises

When you `resolve` or `reject` a Promise, its `.then` / `.catch` handlers are scheduled into the **microtask queue** (also called the “jobs queue”).

Example:

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("promise"));
console.log("sync");
```

👉 Output:

```
sync
promise
```

Notice: just like callbacks, but **Promise callbacks (microtasks) run *before* normal callbacks (macrotasks)** in the event loop.

---

## 3. Priority order

So the priority is:

1. Run all **synchronous code** (top of stack).
2. Then flush the **microtask queue** (Promises, `queueMicrotask`).
3. Then process one **macrotask** (setTimeout, setInterval, I/O callbacks).
4. Repeat.

---

## 4. Async/Await

`async/await` is just **syntactic sugar** over Promises.
When you `await something`, JavaScript pauses until that Promise resolves. Behind the scenes, the continuation (code after the `await`) is scheduled as a microtask.

```js
(async () => {
  await null;
  console.log("await");
})();
console.log("sync");
```

👉 Output:

```
sync
await
```

Because the `await` continuation goes into the microtask queue.

---

## ✅ So to answer your question

* A **Promise** itself is just an object that represents a future value.
* Its `.then()` / `.catch()` handlers are scheduled in the **microtask queue**.
* Classic callbacks like `setTimeout` go into the **macrotask queue**.
* Microtasks always run **before** macrotasks after synchronous code finishes.

⚡ Would you like me to make a **small demo snippet** that mixes sync code, Promises, and callbacks so you can see the exact execution order in Node.js?
