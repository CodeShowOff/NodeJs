In Node.js, `path.resolve()` takes a list of path segments and produces an **absolute path** by:

1. Starting from the **current working directory** (where you ran `node app.js`) if the first argument is **not** already absolute.
2. Resolving `.` and `..` segments like a real file system would.
3. Returning the normalized, absolute result.

### Example

```js
import path from 'path';

console.log(path.resolve('public', 'index.html'));
// -> /Users/you/project/public/index.html
//    (if you ran node from /Users/you/project)

console.log(path.resolve('/var', 'log', 'app.log'));
// -> /var/log/app.log  (already absolute, so it uses it directly)

console.log(path.resolve('src', '..', 'public', 'index.html'));
// -> /Users/you/project/public/index.html
```

### Key difference from `path.join()`

* **`path.join()`** just concatenates and normalizes — it does **not** make the path absolute unless one of the parts is already absolute.
* **`path.resolve()`** always returns an **absolute path**, using the current working directory if necessary.

**Example:**

```js
path.join('src', '..', 'public');
// -> 'src/../public' (relative)

path.resolve('src', '..', 'public');
// -> '/absolute/path/to/public'
```

---

In your case — since your `app.js` is in `src` and you want `public` one folder up —
you could do either:

```js
// with join
join(__dirname, '../public/index.html');

// with resolve
resolve(__dirname, '../public/index.html');
```

Both work the same here because `__dirname` is already absolute.

If you’d like, I can show **when resolve will behave differently from join** in a server project, so you don’t accidentally serve the wrong file.
