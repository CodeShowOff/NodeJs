That’s actually one of the nice things about using `express.static()` — your `.hbs` files don’t need to know they’re in a different folder than your CSS.

Here’s why it works:

---

### 1. You told Express to serve `/public` as the **root** of your static files:

```js
app.use(express.static(publicDirPath));
```

That means everything inside `public` becomes directly accessible from the browser **as if it were in `/`**.

Example:

```
public/css/style.css  →  http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
public/img/Profile.jpg → http://localhost:3000/img/Profile.jpg
```

---

### 2. In your `.hbs` file, you just use the public URL path:

Inside `views/index.hbs`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css" />
```

When the browser requests `/css/style.css`, Express finds it in `public/css/style.css` and sends it back.

---

### 3. It doesn’t matter where your `.hbs` file lives

The `.hbs` file itself is not physically “looking” for the CSS — the browser is.
The browser reads the HTML generated by the `.hbs`, sees:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css" />
```

…and then makes an HTTP request to `/css/style.css` from your server, which your `express.static()` middleware serves.

---

**So, the rule of thumb:**

- `express.static(publicDirPath)` makes everything inside `public` directly accessible from the browser.
- Just reference `/css/...`, `/js/...`, `/img/...` in your `.hbs` like normal.

---

If you want, I can give you a **minimal working `index.hbs` example** with your `style.css` applied so you can test it right away.
