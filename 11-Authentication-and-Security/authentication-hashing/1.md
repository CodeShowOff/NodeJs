Great question! Let’s go step by step on how **bcrypt** hashes a password:

---

### 🔑 1. Algorithm Used

bcrypt is based on the **Blowfish key setup algorithm**. It is a **key-derivation function (KDF)** designed specifically for password hashing. Its main strengths are:

* It is **slow and tunable** (unlike SHA256/MD5).
* It has a **built-in salt**.
* It’s resistant to brute-force and rainbow-table attacks.

---

### ⚙️ 2. Steps in Hashing with bcrypt

1. **Generate a salt**

   * bcrypt generates a **16-byte random salt**.
   * The salt ensures the same password will hash to different outputs.
   * Example salt (Base64 encoded): `$2b$12$eImiTXuWVxfM37uY4JANjQ`

2. **Choose cost factor (work factor)**

   * bcrypt has a parameter called **cost (log rounds)**.
   * Example: `12` means the algorithm will run $2^{12} = 4096$ iterations of the key setup.
   * Higher cost = more computation = stronger security, but slower hashing.

3. **Combine password + salt**

   * bcrypt mixes the password with the salt using the Blowfish key schedule.
   * It repeatedly runs the password and salt through an expensive encryption routine.

4. **Produce final hash**

   * The output is **184-bit (around 60 characters when encoded in bcrypt format)**.
   * The result contains:

     ```
     $2b$12$salt22characters........$hash31characters........
     ```

     * `$2b$` → bcrypt version
     * `12` → cost factor
     * `salt` → 22-character Base64 salt
     * `hash` → 31-character Base64 hash

### 📌 3. Example

Hashing `"password123"` with cost factor `12` might give:

```
$2b$12$C6UzMDM.H6dfI/f/IKcEeO2l8zM3Ge6L8.DaYcOaCj7qf3WJWZ1yK
```

* `$2b$` → bcrypt version
* `12` → cost (2^12 rounds)
* `C6UzMDM.H6dfI/f/IKcEeO` → salt
* `2l8zM3Ge6L8.DaYcOaCj7qf3WJWZ1yK` → final hash

---

### ✅ 4. Key Properties

* **Slow & tunable** → makes brute-force harder.
* **Salted automatically** → prevents rainbow-table attacks.
* **Deterministic for same input** (password + salt + cost) → verification works.

Would you like me to **show you bcrypt hashing in Python** with `bcrypt` library, so you can see the process in code?
