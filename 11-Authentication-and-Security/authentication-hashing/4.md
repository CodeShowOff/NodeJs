Great questions — you’re thinking about this exactly the right way 👏
Let’s break it down slowly without jargon.

## 🔑 1. What is hashing?

Hashing is like putting something into a **blender**:

* You put in `"mypassword"`.
* The blender smashes it up into a smoothie that looks like nonsense:

  ```
  X9a$4!zP0d...etc
  ```
* Once it’s blended, you **cannot get the original fruit back** — the banana and strawberry are lost in the smoothie forever.

That’s what bcrypt does to your password: it blends it in a way that cannot be reversed.

---

## 🛑 2. Why can’t it be unscrambled?

Because hashing is designed to **throw away information**:

* `"mypassword"` and `"mypassword123"` look similar to us,
* but after hashing, they become two totally different random-looking strings.
* The process is one-way. Like burning a piece of paper: you can’t turn ashes back into the paper.

This is **by design** — so even the website storing your password can’t know it.

## 🔎 3. Then how does verification work?

Good question! Here’s the trick:

When you log in:

1. You type `"mypassword"`.
2. bcrypt takes what you typed, runs it through the blender **the same way**.
3. It compares the new smoothie (hash) with the one saved in the database.

   * If they look the same → ✅ password is correct.
   * If not → ❌ wrong password.

The website never needs to "unscramble" your password.
It just compares two blended results.

---

## ✅ Simple Summary

* **Hashing** = blending → can’t get the fruit back.
* **Unscrambling is impossible** because information is lost.
* **Verification works by re-blending** and checking if the results match.
