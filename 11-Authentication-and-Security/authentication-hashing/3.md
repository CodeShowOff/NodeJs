That’s a really good question 🙌 and very common confusion!
Let’s clear it up:

---

### 🔒 1. Hashing ≠ Encryption

* **Encryption** means: you scramble data but can later **unscramble** it if you have the secret key.
  Example: sending a secret message to a friend.
* **Hashing** means: you scramble data in a **one-way process**.
  👉 Once hashed, you can’t “unscramble” it back.

bcrypt is a **hashing algorithm**, not encryption.
So, there’s no “decrypt” button.

---

### 🧩 2. But if the code is public, can’t hackers reverse it?

Nope ✅. The fact that bcrypt’s code is public doesn’t make it weaker. In fact:

* **All good security tools are open** (like locks, safes, SSL/TLS).
* Security comes not from “hiding the method” but from the math behind it being **hard to undo**.
* bcrypt is designed so that, even if you know exactly how it works, you still cannot turn the scrambled text back into the original password.

---

### ⚔️ 3. How do hackers try then?

Since they can’t “unscramble,” hackers usually try:

1. **Guessing passwords** (try `"123456"`, `"password"`, etc.).
2. **Hash each guess with bcrypt**.
3. **See if it matches** the stored scrambled version.

This is called a **brute-force attack**.
That’s why bcrypt:

* Uses **salt** → so they can’t reuse pre-computed tables.
* Uses **cost (slowness)** → so each guess takes much longer.

So even if a hacker steals a whole database of bcrypt hashes, it’s still extremely hard and slow to crack.

---

✅ **Bottom line**:

* bcrypt is public, but it’s still safe.
* You can’t “decrypt” a hash — only compare by hashing again.
* The slowness + randomness make brute-force attacks very expensive.

Would you like me to show you a **toy example with a simple password** so you can see how bcrypt makes it impossible to “go backwards”?
