Ah — excellent catch 🚀 You're asking about something called a **collision** (two different inputs producing the same hash). Let’s carefully sort this out:

---

### 1. In theory vs. in practice

* **In theory:**
  Any hash function takes an infinite number of possible passwords and squeezes them into a fixed-length output (like 60 characters for bcrypt).
  Mathematically, that means collisions *must exist*.

* **In practice (with bcrypt):**
  Bcrypt’s output space is **so huge** (2¹²⁸ possible results or more) that the chance of two different passwords producing the same bcrypt hash is *astronomically tiny*.
  It’s like saying:

  > “Can two people accidentally shuffle a deck of cards into exactly the same order?”
  > Yes, but the odds are so close to zero that you’d never expect it to happen.

### 2. Does this mean your account could be opened with two different passwords?

👉 Realistically, **no**.

* For bcrypt, no one has ever found a practical collision.
* The math is designed so even with billions of computers working for billions of years, you’d almost never find two passwords that hash the same.

So in the real world:

* Only the **exact password you set** will generate the right hash and open your account.
* Different passwords will produce different hashes → login fails.

---

### 3. Why I said "different inputs can map to the same hash"

That was to explain *why it’s not reversible*.
Since many inputs *could* theoretically map to the same output, there’s no way to “go backwards” to find the exact original password.

But those theoretical collisions are so rare in bcrypt that they’re not a concern for your login security.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Yes, collisions exist in theory.
* No, they don’t matter for bcrypt in practice.
* Your account will **only unlock with the correct password**.

Would you like me to explain **why bcrypt’s output space is so large** (the math behind the “astronomically tiny chance”)?
