You’ve nailed the core idea ✅ — let me fine-tune the details so it’s crystal clear.

### 1. Knowing bcrypt’s code + cost

Yes, bcrypt is open-source.
Yes, the cost (like 10, 12, 14) is visible inside the hash.

But that doesn’t mean you can magically “get the password” back.

Why? Because:

* The hash itself looks like random nonsense.
* To check a password, you must **already have a guess** (e.g. `"mypassword"`, `"123456"`, `"iloveyou"`).
* Then you run bcrypt with the same salt + cost → it produces a new hash.
* If that new hash = stored hash → 🎯 you found the password.

So **you still need to guess** — knowing the algorithm doesn’t give you the original input.

---

### 2. Example

Suppose a database shows:

```
$2b$12$C6UzMDM.H6dfI/f/IKcEeO2l8zM3Ge6L8.DaYcOaCj7qf3WJWZ1yK
```

* You see `$2b$` → bcrypt version.
* You see `12` → cost = 2^12 iterations.
* You see salt + hash.

Now let’s say you guess `"mypassword"`.

* Run bcrypt("mypassword", salt, cost=12).
* If the result matches → ✅ correct password.
* If not → ❌ wrong guess.

So even with full knowledge, the only option is **try-and-compare**.

---

### 3. Why it’s still safe

* **Cost slows guessing down.** At cost=12, each guess might take \~100ms. That means only \~10 guesses per second per computer — painfully slow for billions of possible passwords.
* **Salt makes each user unique.** So even if two people use `"mypassword"`, their hashes look different.

---

✅ **So your thought is right:**

* You *can* generate the same hash **if** you know the correct password already.
* But you *cannot* go backwards from the hash to discover the password.
* That’s why bcrypt protects even when attackers see the code, cost, and database.

Do you want me to show you a **mini demo with a real hash** where I try one correct and one wrong password, so you can see the match/no-match in action?
