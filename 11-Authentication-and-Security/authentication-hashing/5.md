Perfect 👌 you want the **real science behind hashing** instead of metaphors — let’s go deep but still clear.

## 🔑 1. Hashing = A Mathematical Transformation

Hashing takes some input (like `"mypassword"`) and runs it through a **mathematical function** that:

* Always produces the **same output** for the same input.
* Produces something that looks **random**.
* Is designed so you **cannot reverse it**.

Example (not bcrypt, just a simple hash):

```
Input:  "cat"
Hash:   "0x77af778b51abd4"
```

If you hash `"cat"` again tomorrow, you’ll get the same result.
But from `"0x77af778b51abd4"`, there’s no formula to get back `"cat"`.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Why can’t it be reversed?

Because hash functions **throw away and mix up information** in a one-way process.

Imagine this simple rule (just an example):

```
Take all letters → convert to numbers → add them up.
```

* "cat" → 3 + 1 + 20 = 24
* "dog" → 4 + 15 + 7 = 26

Now if I just tell you “24”, can you know for sure it was `"cat"`?
👉 No, because many different words might add up to 24.
That’s the essence: **different inputs can lead to the same hash**, so you can’t reverse it.

Real hash functions like bcrypt are way more complex: they mix bits, shift numbers, apply cryptographic operations thousands of times. The math is intentionally messy so going backwards is practically impossible.

## 🔍 3. Then how does verification work?

The trick is: we **don’t need to reverse**.

Steps:

1. You set a password `"mypassword"`.

   * bcrypt runs its math → produces `"Xyz123..."`.
   * Website stores `"Xyz123..."` in the database.

2. Later you log in and type `"mypassword"`.

   * bcrypt runs the **same math again**.
   * If the result is `"Xyz123..."` again → ✅ match.
   * If not → ❌ wrong.

So verification is just:
👉 “Hash the input again and compare.”

## 📌 4. Why bcrypt is special

Normal hash functions (like MD5, SHA256) are **fast** — good for data integrity but bad for passwords, because hackers can try billions per second.
bcrypt adds:

* **Salt** → random extra input so no two hashes look alike.
* **Cost factor** → repeats the math thousands of times to make guessing slower.

---

✅ **Summary of the science:**

* Hashing = one-way math function.
* Not reversible because multiple inputs can lead to the same scrambled output.
* Verification works by hashing again and comparing.
* bcrypt makes it slow + unique to defend against hackers.
