Got it 👍 — let me explain bcrypt hashing in **simple, non-technical terms**.

---

### Imagine you have a password:

👉 `"mypassword"`

Now, if websites just stored `"mypassword"` directly, a hacker could easily steal it.
So instead, they **scramble** it using bcrypt.

---

### How bcrypt scrambles your password:

1. **Add some secret randomness (salt)**

   * Think of it like adding extra secret "spice" to your password before scrambling.
   * Example: instead of `"mypassword"`, it becomes something like `"mypassword+xyz123"`.

2. **Mix it again and again (cost/work factor)**

   * bcrypt doesn’t just scramble once.
   * It scrambles your password thousands of times.
   * The more times it scrambles, the **slower it is for hackers** to guess.
   * Websites can choose how many times (this is the “cost”).

3. **Save only the scrambled version**

   * The final scrambled text looks like complete nonsense, e.g.:

     ```
     $2b$12$C6UzMDM.H6dfI/f/IKcEeO2l8zM3Ge6L8.DaYcOaCj7qf3WJWZ1yK
     ```
   * This is what the website stores in its database — **never your real password**.

---

### When you log in later:

* You type `"mypassword"`.
* bcrypt scrambles it again in the exact same way.
* If the scrambled result **matches** what’s stored, then your password is correct.

---

✅ So in short:

* **Salt** = the extra random "spice" added.
* **Cost** = how many times bcrypt scrambles to make it slower for hackers.
* **Hash** = the final scrambled nonsense text that gets stored.

Do you want me to give you a **real-life analogy** (like cooking or locking a door) so it’s even easier to picture?
