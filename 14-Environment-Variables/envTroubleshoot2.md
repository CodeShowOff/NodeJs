Got it üëç Thanks for pasting the exact log ‚Äî this makes the problem clear.

The key issue is here:

```
API key does not start with "SG.".
undefined
```

That means when you read `process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY`, it‚Äôs coming back as **`undefined`**, and then the SendGrid library complains because it‚Äôs not getting a valid key.

---

### üîç Why it happens

1. **`.env` file location**
   The `.env` must be in the **project root** (same level as `package.json`), **not inside `src/`**.

2. **`.env` file encoding/format**
   On Windows, sometimes `.env` ends up saved as `UTF-8 with BOM`, or gets a hidden `.txt` extension.
   Check in VS Code ‚Üí bottom bar should say `UTF-8`. If not, re-save as *UTF-8 without BOM*.

   Also run:

   ```bash
   dir /a
   ```

   in your project folder to confirm it‚Äôs literally named `.env` (not `.env.txt`).

3. **Order of loading**
   You must call `dotenv.config()` **before** you use `process.env`.

   ```js
   import dotenv from "dotenv";
   dotenv.config();

   import express from "express"; // after dotenv
   ```

4. **Extra spaces in `.env`**
   Must look exactly like:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxx
   ```

   ‚ùå Not like:

   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY = SG.xxxxxxxx
   "SENDGRID_API_KEY"=SG.xxxxxxxx
   ```

### ‚úÖ Quick Debug

Right after `dotenv.config()`, add:

```js
console.log("ENV loaded:", process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);
console.log("All ENV keys:", Object.keys(process.env));
```

If you see `undefined`, then `.env` is either not being loaded, or is misnamed/misformatted.

üëâ Want me to give you a **minimal working repo structure + code snippet** (with `.env`, `index.js`, and `package.json`) that you can copy-paste and test, so we can be 100% sure it works on your machine?
