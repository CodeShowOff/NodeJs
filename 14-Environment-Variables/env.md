Great question — you’re absolutely right that you should **never commit API keys** directly to GitHub. The modern and safe way in Node.js is to use **environment variables** with a `.env` file (which you never commit). Here’s the standard modern approach:

---

### 1. Install `dotenv`

This package is the de-facto way to load environment variables from a `.env` file in Node.js.

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

---

### 2. Create a `.env` file

At the root of your project, create a `.env` file (and make sure to add it to `.gitignore`).

```env
API_KEY=your-secret-api-key-here
```

---

### 3. Load it in your app

At the very top of your entry file (e.g., `index.js`, `server.js`, etc.):

```js
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

console.log(process.env.API_KEY); // now it's available!
```

---

### 4. Use it safely

Whenever you need the API key in your code:

```js
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

---

### 5. Don’t commit secrets

Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore`:

```
# .gitignore
.env
```

---

### 6. Deployment (modern hosting)

When you deploy (e.g., to **Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, Heroku, or AWS**), you don’t upload your `.env` file.
Instead, those platforms have **built-in dashboards** where you define environment variables, and they’ll be injected into `process.env` automatically.

---

✅ This is the "modern way":

* Use `.env` locally with `dotenv`.
* Use platform-specific environment settings in production.
* Never commit `.env`.

---

Do you want me to also show you how to **structure your project** so you can separate secrets for development vs. production (like `.env.development` and `.env.production`)?
