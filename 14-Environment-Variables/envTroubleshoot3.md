Thanks for showing the full structure üôå That helps a lot.

Your layout looks totally fine:

```
tasks-app/
  .env   ‚úÖ
  package.json
  src/
    index.js
    emails/accounts.js
    ...
```

So if `.env` is at the root (same level as `package.json`), then the only reason `process.env.PORT` or `process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY` is `undefined` inside `accounts.js` is **load order**.

---

## üö® The Real Problem

When you use ES modules (`import ...`), **all imports are hoisted and executed before the rest of your `index.js` code runs**.

That means this in `index.js`:

```js
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();
```

is too late, because `accounts.js` may have already run while being imported through your routers.

---

## ‚úÖ Fix

### 1. Create a dedicated env loader

Make sure `.env` loads **before any other imports**.

üìÑ `src/config/env.js`

```js
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();
```

---

### 2. Import it first in `index.js`

üìÑ `src/index.js`

```js
import "./config/env.js"; // must be first

import express from "express";
import "./db/mongoose.js";
import userRouter from "./routers/user.js";
import taskRouter from "./routers/task.js";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(userRouter);
app.use(taskRouter);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

---

### 3. Remove `dotenv.config()` from other files

Now in `accounts.js` you can safely do:

üìÑ `src/emails/accounts.js`

```js
import sgMail from "@sendgrid/mail";

console.log("PORT from accounts.js:", process.env.PORT);
console.log("SENDGRID_API_KEY from accounts.js:", process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

export const sendWelcomeEmail = (email, name) => {
  const msg = {
    to: email,
    from: "911hellocop@gmail.com", // must be verified in SendGrid
    subject: "Welcome to Tasks-App",
    text: `Welcome to the app, ${name}.`,
  };
  return sgMail.send(msg);
};
```

---

## üîç Why this works

* `import "./config/env.js";` runs **before anything else** in your app.
* That ensures `dotenv.config()` is called before `accounts.js` or any router touches `process.env`.
* Now `process.env.PORT` and `process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY` will both be defined everywhere.

üëâ Do you want me to rewrite your project tree (with `src/config/env.js` added and fixed imports) so you can copy-paste the final structure?
