Alright â€” fresh slate ðŸ™‚

Letâ€™s compare **top-level `await`** vs. `async` functions and the event loop.

## ðŸ”¹ Top-level `await`

When you write something like:

```js
console.log("A");
const res = await fetch("https://example.com");
console.log("B");
```

at the **top level of an ES module**:

1. The JavaScript engine **pauses module evaluation** at the `await`.

   * That means `"A"` is printed.
   * The module execution halts right there until the `fetch` promise settles.

2. While paused, the engine can continue executing other tasks (other scripts, timers, event handlers, etc.) â€” so the event loop is not blocked, only this moduleâ€™s evaluation is paused.

3. Once the awaited promise resolves, execution of that module continues: `"B"` is printed.

ðŸ‘‰ So yes, *top-level await pauses further synchronous execution of that particular module until the awaited promise resolves*. Other parts of the program (other modules, the event loop) continue normally.

## ðŸ”¹ Inside an `async` function

Example:

```js
console.log("A");
async function run() {
  const res = await fetch("https://example.com");
  console.log("B");
}
run();
console.log("C");
```

Step by step:

1. `"A"` is printed.
2. `run()` is called.

   * Because `run` is `async`, calling it returns a **Promise immediately**.
   * The body of `run` runs **synchronously until the first `await`**. So it kicks off `fetch(...)`, then suspends at `await`.
3. Control returns to the caller right away â€” `"C"` is printed.
   (Because the function has suspended at the `await`.)
4. Later, when the fetch promise resolves, the event loop schedules the continuation of `run`. `"B"` is printed then.

ðŸ‘‰ So, async functions donâ€™t *block* synchronous code. They schedule their continuation as a microtask once the awaited promise settles.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Comparing the two

* **Top-level `await`**

  * Halts evaluation of that module until the promise settles.
  * Later statements in that module wait.
  * But the event loop continues â€” timers, other modules, etc. still run.

* **`async` function**

  * Returns a promise immediately.
  * The async body runs until the first `await`, then pauses.
  * The rest of the surrounding synchronous code outside the function continues right away.
  * The continuation is resumed asynchronously (microtask) when the awaited promise settles.

---

âœ… So your intuition was close:

* **Top-level `await`** = pause this moduleâ€™s execution until resolved.
* **Async function** = schedules work with the event loop; synchronous code outside continues immediately.

Would you like me to draw a **timeline diagram** showing the console output order for both cases (top-level vs inside async)?
