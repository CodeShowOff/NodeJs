Excellent 👏 — you’ve got the right intuition. Let’s go step by step into the **exact timing** of when code inside a `Promise` runs, when things get pushed to queues, and how the event loop handles it.

---

## 1. When does a `Promise` start executing?

```js
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("executor runs");
  resolve("done");
});
```

👉 Output:

```
executor runs
```

* The **executor function** (the function you pass into `new Promise(...)`) runs **immediately, synchronously**, at the moment you create the promise.
* This is different from `setTimeout`, which defers execution.

So:

* The code inside the `Promise` constructor executes **right away** (during the synchronous phase).
* Only the `.then` / `.catch` **handlers** are deferred.

---

## 2. When do `.then` / `.catch` handlers run?

```js
const p = new Promise(resolve => {
  console.log("inside executor");
  resolve(42);
});

p.then(v => console.log("then:", v));

console.log("after promise");
```

👉 Output:

```
inside executor
after promise
then: 42
```

Why?

* Executor runs immediately → logs `"inside executor"`.
* `resolve(42)` marks the promise as **fulfilled**, but does not run handlers yet.
* `.then(...)` registers a callback → the JS engine schedules it as a **microtask**.
* The event loop finishes the current stack (`after promise`).
* Then it flushes the microtask queue (`then: 42`).

---

## 3. So what’s pushed into the microtask queue?

* The executor code itself? ❌ No, that runs immediately.
* The callback you pass into `.then` / `.catch` / `.finally`? ✅ Yes, those are queued as **microtasks**.

---

## 4. Timeline with example

```js
console.log("1");

const p = new Promise(resolve => {
  console.log("2");
  resolve("3");
});

p.then(v => console.log(v));

console.log("4");
```

👉 Output:

```
1
2
4
3
```

**Step by step:**

1. `console.log("1")` → runs sync.
2. `new Promise(...)` runs executor → logs `"2"`.
3. `resolve("3")` fulfills the promise → schedules `.then(...)` callback as microtask.
4. `console.log("4")` → still sync.
5. Event loop flushes microtask queue → runs `.then` callback → logs `"3"`.

---

## 5. Big picture

* **Executor (inside `new Promise`)** → runs immediately, synchronously.
* **`.then/.catch/.finally` callbacks** → scheduled as **microtasks** when the promise is settled.
* **Event loop order:**

  1. Run all synchronous code (call stack).
  2. Flush microtask queue (promises, `queueMicrotask`).
  3. Run one macrotask (timers, I/O).
  4. Repeat.

---

## 6. Visual analogy

* Creating a promise = “start cooking immediately” 🍳.
* `.then` = “call me back when it’s ready.” That callback is put on a **VIP queue** (microtask).
* Event loop = “finish all current tasks, then check the VIP queue before moving on.”

---

✅ So to your exact question:

* The **executor** of a Promise runs immediately (not scheduled).
* The **handlers (`then`, `catch`)** are scheduled into the **microtask queue**, and only run **after the current synchronous code is finished**.

---

Would you like me to also explain what happens when you `return` another Promise inside `.then` (i.e., **Promise unwrapping / flattening**) — that’s where people usually get confused about *when* the next `.then` is scheduled?
