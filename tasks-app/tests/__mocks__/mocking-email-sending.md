Yes, that’s the same idea 👍 — but a little different in **what you’re mocking**.

Let’s compare:

---

### 🔹 Mocking **`accounts.js` directly**

```js
jest.mock('../src/emails/accounts', () => ({
  sendWelcomeEmail: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
  sendCancelEmail: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve())
}));
```

* This replaces your whole `accounts.js` module with fake functions.
* Your tests won’t run the real `sgMail.send()` at all.
* Good if you only want to check that your code *calls* `sendWelcomeEmail()` or `sendCancelEmail()`, not that they build the correct SendGrid message.

---

### 🔹 Mocking **`@sendgrid/mail`**

```js
jest.mock('@sendgrid/mail', () => ({
  setApiKey: jest.fn(),
  send: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve("mocked email sent"))
}));
```

* This replaces the SendGrid library itself.
* Your real `accounts.js` code still runs, but instead of hitting SendGrid’s servers, the mocked `send()` is called.
* Good if you want to test that `accounts.js` builds the right `msg` object and passes it to `sgMail.send()`.

---

✅ **Which one to choose?**

* If you just want to avoid network calls and don’t care about testing the internals of `accounts.js` → mock `accounts.js`.
* If you want to test that your email payloads (`to`, `subject`, etc.) are correct → mock `@sendgrid/mail`.

---

👉 Do you want your tests to **verify the actual email payload** (like subject & recipient), or do you only care that `sendWelcomeEmail` / `sendCancelEmail` get *called*?
