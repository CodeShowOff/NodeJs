Yes â€” and thatâ€™s **exactly what your current code is already doing** ðŸ™‚

Letâ€™s walk through it carefully:

---

### ðŸ”¹ What you suggested

Youâ€™re saying:

1. Decode the token (verify it with `jwt.verify`).
2. Find the user by `_id`.
3. Loop through/check if that exact token exists in the userâ€™s `tokens` array.
4. If yes â†’ call `next()`, else â†’ reject.

---

### ðŸ”¹ What the current code does

```js
const user = await User.findOne({ _id: decoded._id, 'tokens.token': token });
```

This line is basically steps **2 + 3 combined into one** query.

* `decoded._id` â†’ finds the user.
* `'tokens.token': token` â†’ makes sure that specific token exists in their DB record.

If the query finds nothing, it means:

* User doesnâ€™t exist anymore, OR
* Token is not in their tokens list (maybe logged out or revoked).

In either case, you reject with `401 Unauthorized`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why not just `findById` then loop manually?

You could absolutely do this instead:

```js
const user = await User.findById(decoded._id);
if (!user || !user.tokens.some((t) => t.token === token)) {
    throw new Error();
}
```

This works the same way âœ… â€” but itâ€™s two steps:

* Fetch user
* Check token array in JS

Whereas the current approach just offloads the filtering logic to MongoDB itself, so it comes back with either the right user or `null`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why prefer the DB query way?

* **Efficiency**: MongoDB does the filtering for you, no need to pull the full tokens array into memory unless you need it.
* **Clarity**: One concise query = less code.
* **Consistency**: Prevents bugs where you forget to manually check the token after finding by ID.

---

ðŸ‘‰ So yes, what you suggested (looping manually) would work fine, but the current approach is just a cleaner + more efficient version of the same logic.

Would you like me to show you what the **logout route** looks like in both styles (DB query vs loop-check), so you can compare side by side?
