Great question üëç this is one of those subtle design decisions in JWT + Mongoose auth systems that often trips people up.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### 1. `jwt.verify(token, secret)`

When you call this, you‚Äôre only checking **two things**:

* The token‚Äôs signature is valid (i.e., it was signed by your server with the correct secret).
* The token hasn‚Äôt expired (if you set `exp`).

That‚Äôs it.
It does **not** check whether the token is still "active" or "valid" in your database.

---

### 2. Why do we query `User.findOne({ _id: decoded._id, 'tokens.token': token })`?

This extra check is a **security feature**.

Here‚Äôs why:

* When a user logs in, you generate a JWT and store it in their `tokens` array (`user.tokens.push({ token })`).
* If the user later **logs out**, you remove that token from their tokens array.
* If you only verified the JWT with `jwt.verify`, the token would still be valid even after logout, because JWTs are self-contained.
* By checking the token‚Äôs presence in the DB, you enforce **server-side revocation** ‚Üí only tokens that are currently stored in `tokens` are valid.

---

### 3. Why not just check by `_id`?

If you only do:

```js
User.findById(decoded._id)
```

then:

* Any valid JWT ever issued for that user will continue to work forever (until expiration), even if the user has logged out or you wanted to revoke it.
* You lose the ability to implement things like "logout all sessions" (clear `tokens` array).

That‚Äôs why most systems store tokens in DB (or cache) ‚Üí so you can revoke them anytime.

---

### 4. Alternative approaches

There are two common patterns:

* **Stateless JWT**: Don‚Äôt store tokens in DB. Tokens remain valid until expiry. Logout just means "forget it client-side." Simple, but you cannot revoke tokens early.
* **Stateful JWT** (your approach): Store tokens in DB, check presence on every request. Slightly less "JWT-pure," but lets you revoke tokens at will ‚Üí more secure.

---

‚úÖ **So, short answer**:
We don‚Äôt just trust the decoded `_id` because JWTs are self-contained and don‚Äôt support revocation by default. By storing tokens in the DB and checking `tokens.token`, we can revoke tokens (logout, logout-all, admin invalidation, etc.), which makes the system safer.

---

Do you want me to also show you how the `logout` and `logoutAll` endpoints would work with this design, so the `tokens.token` check makes more sense in practice?
