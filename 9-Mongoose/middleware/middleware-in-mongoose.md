In **Mongoose** (the ODM library for MongoDB in Node.js), **middleware** (also called *pre* and *post* hooks) are functions that run **before or after** certain actions in the Mongoose lifecycle, such as saving a document, validating data, updating, or removing.

Theyâ€™re useful for adding logic like validation, logging, password hashing, sending notifications, etc.

### Types of Middleware in Mongoose

1. **Document Middleware**
   Runs **before or after document methods** like `save()`, `validate()`, `remove()`.

   * `pre()` â†’ runs before the action.
   * `post()` â†’ runs after the action.

   ```js
   const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     username: String,
     password: String
   });

   // Pre-save middleware (runs before saving to DB)
   userSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {
     if (this.isModified('password')) {
       this.password = await hashPassword(this.password);
     }
     next();
   });

   // Post-save middleware (runs after saving to DB)
   userSchema.post('save', function (doc) {
     console.log(`User ${doc.username} was saved.`);
   });
   ```

---

2. **Query Middleware**
   Runs before or after query methods (`find`, `findOne`, `updateOne`, etc.).

   ```js
   // Runs before any "find" query
   userSchema.pre('find', function (next) {
     this.where({ active: true }); // automatically filter inactive users
     next();
   });
   ```

---

3. **Aggregate Middleware**
   Runs before or after aggregation pipelines (`Model.aggregate()`).

   ```js
   userSchema.pre('aggregate', function (next) {
     this.pipeline().unshift({ $match: { isDeleted: false } });
     next();
   });
   ```

---

4. **Model Middleware**
   Runs for model-level methods like `insertMany`.

---

### Why Middleware is Useful

* **Password hashing** before saving users.
* **Auditing/logging** DB changes.
* **Cascading deletes** (removing related documents).
* **Auto-populating** related fields.
* **Validations** beyond schema rules.

---

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **Mongoose middleware are lifecycle hooks that let you run custom logic before/after Mongoose operations.**

Would you like me to also show you a **real-world example** (like hashing a password before saving a user), so itâ€™s clearer how middleware is applied?
